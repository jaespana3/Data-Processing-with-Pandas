# Spotify Top 50 Tracks Analysis

## Project Overview

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Spotify Top 50 Tracks of 2020 dataset sourced from Kaggle. The goal is to practice data loading, cleaning, and exploratory querying using Python's Pandas library, focusing on the dataset’s structure and characteristics.

## Dataset

* **Source:** Spotify Top 50 Tracks of 2020 (Kaggle)
* **Contents:** Information about 50 top tracks, including various audio features and metadata.

## Analysis Objectives

* Load and clean the dataset by handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
* Explore dataset structure: number of observations, features, and their types (categorical/numeric).
* Identify repeated artists and albums in the top 50.
* Filter tracks by specific audio feature criteria (e.g., danceability, loudness).
* Investigate feature correlations.
* Compare audio features across several key genres: Pop, Hip-Hop/Rap, Dance/Electronic, and Alternative/Indie.
* Document clear explanations on methods and results throughout the notebook.
* Suggest potential improvements for the analysis approach.
